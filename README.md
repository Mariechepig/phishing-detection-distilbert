# Phishing Email Detection using DistilBERT

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a transformer-based model (DistilBERT)
for phishing email detection.

DistilBERT is a lightweight version of BERT that retains
most of the language understanding capabilities
while being faster and more efficient.
